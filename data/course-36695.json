{"courseName":"Scalable Data Management for Data Science","ects":"4","Responsible Instructor":"Prof.dr.ir.A.P.deVries    ,A.P.deVries@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/0/2Pract.","Education Period":"4","Start Education":"4","Exam Period":"none","Course Language":"English","Study Goals":"The course has three goals:1. Theory: Database technology has been successful for administrative data because it offers a balance between flexibility and efficiency. The course investigates how the fundamentals of database technology can be applied also to create support platforms for heterogeneous multimedia dataspaces.2. Learn to work with research papers (and recognize their limitations).3. Gain practical \"engineering\" skills when turning research ideas into a prototype implementation.","Education Method":"Lectures, lab work.","Literature and Study Materials":"Reader (made available online).","Assessment":"Paper presentation, participation in class, project assignment.","Remarks":"The course is organized as follows. Each student organizes one of the classes, in which a research paper on the topics related to class is discussed. During the course period, students develop a prototype that illustrates one or more aspects of multimedia search and its implications on data management. Assessment is based on class participation, the quality of the presentation of the research paper treated, and a short report and demonstration of the prototype work performed.","id":36695}
