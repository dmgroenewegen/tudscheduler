Before starting the thesis project, students must satisfy the following entry requirements.-Successful completion of all common core courses-For students who started the MSc programme in 2006 or after, but before 2012: completion of at least 57 EC of the Master's degree programme-For students who started the MSc programme in 2012 or after: completion of at least 63 EC of the Master's degree programme and in possession of a Thesis Entrance Permit (TEP)Note: In some cases, the thesis supervisor may impose additional conditions for starting this project.","Assessment":"The thesis committee assesses the thesis and the defense on the following criteria: quality of work: novelty, volume, grasp, methodology, publishable;personal performance: autonomy, planning, creativity, attitude; quality of thesis report: clarity, organisation, argumentation; oral presentation and defense: clarity, focus, relevance, discussion. These criteria are published in the study guide and should be known to the student beforehand. (Use \"Thesis evaluation form\").The voting members of the thesis committee determine the final grade.

The chair may advice to add an extra member to the thesis committee.The motivation for the grade at each of the four criteria as listed above is summarized on a form (Use: \"Thesis evaluation form\") and signed by the chairman of the thesis committee. The candidate is given a short account of the assessment, either in private or in front of the audience.","id":36663}
