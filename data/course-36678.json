This requirement is equivalent to having passed the course TI 2216M in our second year Bachelor curriculum \"Probability and Statistics\". We will be refreshing some concepts on Probability, but we will not be refreshing concepts on Object Oriented Programming.","Study Goals":"The goals of this course are twofold. First, to expose students to the increasingly important area of mobile computing. Students will learn how mobile phones can be used to solve problems in areas ranging from health care and indoor localization to song recognition and traffic management. Second, to provide students with a basic set of tools to develop their own applications. For students aiming for industry, the course should enhance their ability to use theoretical tools to solve practical problems. For students involved on research activities, the course will provide them with the necessary background to use smartphones as a distributed sensing and processing unit that could be used to solve the particular problems in their areas.","Education Method":"Lectures","Literature and Study Materials":"Web","Assessment":"Written reports + project presentation + oral exam","id":36678}
