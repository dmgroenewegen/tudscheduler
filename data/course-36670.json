{"courseName":"Language Engineering Project","ects":"5","Responsible Instructor":"Prof.dr.E.Visser    ,E.Visser@tudelft.nl","Instructor":"G.H.Wachsmuth    ,G.H.Wachsmuth@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/0/4","Education Period":"4","Start Education":"4","Exam Period":"none","Course Language":"English","Expected prior knowledge":"Students are expected to have completed the compiler construction course IN4303.","Study Goals":"Learn to apply language engineering principles and tools to a real (domain-specific) programming language. Explore the definition of all aspects of a programming language: syntax, name binding, type analysis, transformations, code generation.","Education Method":"This is a project course. Students deepen their language engineering skills and insights by building a complete language definition. Students work in small teams on the definition of a (domain-specific) programming language using the Spoofax Language Workbench. Assistance and feedback is provided during weekly lab hours. The project should span the full life cycle of language implementation including a test suite, IDE, code generator, and distribution of the result as an Eclipse plugin.","Assessment":"The work is assessed based on a code review of the language definition and a written report about the project. The work needs to be submitted in four intermediate stages with a deadline and a grade. The final grade is the weighted average of these intermediate grades.","id":36670}
