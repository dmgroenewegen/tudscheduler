{"courseName":"Functional Genomics and Systems Biology","ects":"6","Responsible Instructor":"Prof.dr.ir.M.J.T.Reinders    ,M.J.T.Reinders@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/2/2","Education Period":"3,4","Start Education":"3","Exam Period":"Exam by appointment","Course Language":"English","Expected prior knowledge":"The student is expected to have a basic knowledge of molecular biology, statistics and linear algebra. It is advisable to have followed IN4085 (Pattern Recognition) and IN4329 (Advanced Bioinformatics).","Study Goals":"After succesfully completing this course, a student is able to: list the basic elements of a living cell and their interactions, and describe how these can be measured; explain what type of mathematical model is applicable to what measurement(s), at what level(s), in a given systems biology problem; read and comment upon recent systems biology literature; discuss the state-of-the-art in systems biology and integrative bioinformatics, and future challenges.","Education Method":"The course will consist of a mixture of lectures by the teachers and paper presentations by one or more of the students. All other students will hand in a review-type discussion on one aspect of the paper. A discussion is required for each scheduled presentation (i.e. there are meetings for which 2 such discussions are required). There will also be a practical session allowing students to get hands-on experience with network models, integration and analysis, mainly through Cytoscape.","Literature and Study Materials":"Slides, collection of papers and lab course manual (Blackboard).","Assessment":"The weekly discussion papers will be graded. A final grade for the course will be based on these grades as well as on a final written assignment.","Remarks":"As students depend on each other (to present the material to the class), a commitment to follow the course through to the end is required.","id":36707}
