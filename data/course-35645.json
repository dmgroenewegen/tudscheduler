{"courseName":"Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems","ects":"5","Responsible Instructor":"M.A.Zu�iga Zamalloa    ,M.A.ZunigaZamalloa@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/4/0/0","Education Period":"2","Start Education":"2","Exam Period":"2,3","Course Language":"English","Study Goals":"At the end of the course, the student has a good overview over the specific formalisms that are used when quantitative aspects like time, probability and resource usage play a role in the analysis of system behavior. The student knows how to use these formalisms and what their limitations are. In particular, the student has detailed knowledge of the relevant state-automata and event-graphs, the relevant transition-system based and order based semantics, and the process equivalences and verification-techniques for logics in this area. Also, the student has gained experience with the gathering of quantitative data and the use of several analysis tools for verification and validation of formal models based on such data.","Education Method":"Lectures + Hands-on Sessions","Assessment":"Written exam + practicals","id":35645}
