Emphasis will be put on the concept and role of ICT-architectures to model information needs and services in order to properly design ICT solutions within a multi-actor context. Attention will be paid to relevant aspects such as flexibility, adaptivity, and accountability. Next, the students will learn how to plan and design a large scale ICT implementation project by partitioning it in phases with for each the suitable decision moments. Finally, students will learn methods and tools for designing IT-services.","Study Goals":"1.The student is able to describe basic concepts related to designing large and complex ICT-infrastructures and service systems.2.The student is able to analyse and discuss problems with regard to designing large ICT-systems.3.The student is able to apply system engineering and architecture-based approaches to deal with problems with regard to designing large ICT-systems.4.The student is able to describe methods and tools for designing large and complex ICT-infrastructures and service systems within a multiple actor context.5.The student is able to apply methods and tools for designing large and complex ICT-infrastructures and service systems within a multiple actor context.6.The student is able to explain how to apply architectural concepts for translating business needs into ICT-designs within constellation of public and private actors.","Education Method":"� Lectures� Guest lectures (obliged)� Assignments","Literature and Study Materials":"-N.
