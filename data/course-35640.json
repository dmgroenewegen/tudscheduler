Applications of image registration.The student is able to explain the properties of image registration and optic flow and comprehend the aperture problem in optic flow.5.Image Restoration:Noise filtering, Wiener filtering, Inverse filtering, Geometric transformation, Grey value interpolationThe student is able to discuss the use of linear and non-linear noise filters, explain the use of inverse filters andproblems of inverse filtering in the case of noise, describe (the use of) a Wiener filter and apply geometric transformations and bi-linear grey value interpolation6.Image Segmentation:Thresholding, edge and contour detection, data-driven and model-driven image segmentation, edge trackingThe student is able to discuss isodata thresholding, optimal thresholding, multimodal thresholding and adaptive thresholding techniques,apply Gaussian derivative filters and difference based filters for calculation of edge point candidates, explain the trade off between localization and detection of edges, discuss split and merge techniques and edge tracking techniques. The student has insight into model-based image segmentation (object detection) approaches like template matching, Hough Transform, Deformable Template matching, Active Contours and Active Shape models and is able to formulate how shape information and image intensity information can be incorporated into these approaches.","Education Method":"lectures, group assignment with plenar presentation and discussion","Computer Use":"Matlab and dipimage toolbox and/or other imaging toolbox","Literature and Study Materials":"Book 'Digital Image Processing', van R.C.
