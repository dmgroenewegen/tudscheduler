Tanenbaum, Maarten Van Steen, Distributed Systems, Principles and Paradigms (2nd Edition), Prentice Hall, 2006. The textbook introduces the student to the traditional theory of distributed systems.Additional material: Several relevant research articles introduce the student to the latest advances on the topic.","Assessment":"Overview: The course consists of two main parts: the theoretical Part I and the practical Part II. Students are assessed through a written exam (open questions), an oral exam, and a demonstration of practical skills. Part I: An optional mid-term exam is also organized. The results of the mid-term exam count only if the final exam is also taken by the student, and only if it increases the final grade of the student. Additionally, the course is gamified: there is testing through open questions and various exercises during and at the end of the lectures, counting as bonus points for Part I.The result of Part I of this course must be at least 6. The result of Part II of this course (practical) must be Completed (C, Voltooid/V in Dutch). The final grade is the result of Part I.Summary of assessment:Type of assessmentPart of final gradePart I: Exam, open questions40%Part I: Exam, oral20%Part II: Practical40%","id":36680}
