{"courseName":"Seminar Algorithms: Economics and Computation","ects":"5","Responsible Instructor":"Dr.M.M.deWeerdt    ,M.M.deWeerdt@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/0/2, seminar","Education Period":"4","Start Education":"4","Exam Period":"none","Course Language":"English","Expected prior knowledge":"For this course you need to be able to read scientific papers/books (e.g. you have followed the bachelor seminar course), and you need to be able to understand and analyse algorithms (e.g. followed a course on algorithm design).Also, it is preferred to have some knowledge and experience with reasoning about the computational complexity of problems (e.g. from a course on complexity theory).","Study Goals":"After completion of this course, the student has an overview of the state of the art and main challenges on the border of computer science and economics.He/she can name applications and give definitions and (dis)advantages of a number of formal models and methods for these applications.Furthermore, the student is able to prepare and give an interactive lecture on these topics based on the provided chapters, including: - defining lecture goals - making a lecture plan, and - making exam questions.","Education Method":"Student seminar; since we need to allocate topics, please register for this course on Blackboard before the course starts.","Literature and Study Materials":"A selection of chapters from the following book will be made available:David Parkes and Sven Seuken. Economics and Computation. 2015.","Assessment":"The end grade will be based on:* Quality of preparation and lecture of the chapter studied (50%). * Question answering during the seminar (10%).* Result of a final test on all chapters (40%).On Blackboard there are extensive guidelines regarding the evaluation of the lecture and its preparation.","id":36682}
