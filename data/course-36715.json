Instead of the teachers giving lectures about the methodologies, the students are stimulated to read, study and comprehend the available course material. To do so the following format has been chosen: � Each week there are one or two lectures, each of 45 minutes.� In each lecture one paper (the course material) will be discussed in detail.� One student will present and explain the details of this paper. It is essential that you highlight the (bioinformatics) methodology of the paper.� All students are expected to have read the paper and should have an active role in the discussion about the paper.� When the students in discussion with the teachers are not able to grasp the followed methodology in the paper, the teachers will explain this on the spot.� Each week, an exercise on one of the papers discussed will be handed out.","Assessment":"Written examination","id":36715}
