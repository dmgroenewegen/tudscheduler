The lectures will be given in a block of 2-3 weeks at Delft University of Technology. After that, several interactive sessions (including student presentations and code reviews) with the USA (Silicon Valley) will be held over skype. Due to the 9 hour time difference, these sessions will take place in the (early) evening.The exact timing of the blocks in Delft differs per year, and will be announced on blackboard.","Literature and Study Materials":"- research papers distributed via blackboard- Jesse Liberty and Paul Betts: Programming Reactive Extensions and LINQ, APress, 2011.
