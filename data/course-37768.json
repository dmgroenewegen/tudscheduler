Quantum computers offer exponential speedup over any classical computer. Similarly, quantum communication offers many advantages, including the ability to create secure encryption keys where security rests only on the laws of nature. Synopsis:This class will teach you the fundamental principles of quantum information. You will learn essential concepts that distinguish quantum from classical devices. You will learn about quantum bits and the quantum operations and measurements that can be performed on them. You will learn the basic techniques used in quantum algorithms, and examine basic examples of such algorithms. You will also take the first step in understanding how a quantum bit can be physically implemented. Aim: To learn the fundamental concepts underlying quantum computation and communication systems.","Education Method":"Taught in Quarter 1 of 2015-16; 3 hours of lecture, 1 hour tutorial per week.","Literature and Study Materials":"The main reference textbook for the course will be Nielsen and Chuang, �Quantum Computation and Information�, Cambridge University Press.","Assessment":"60% homework assignments, 10% in class quiz, 30% final exam.","Permitted Materials during Tests":"","Continuing Courses":"CS4090 � Quantum Communication and Cryptography; AP3292D � Quantum Hardware;ET4575 � Quantum Electronics.","id":37768}
