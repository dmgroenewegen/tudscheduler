The student knows the fundamental theory necessary for specifying the behaviour of embedded systems and for reasoning about this behaviour.2. The student can describe simple systems using this theory.3. The student can formally specify requirements and prove (or disprove) them on the behaviour.4. The student is able to model a concrete embedded system,and verify that it satisfies its requirements.","Education Method":"Lectures + Practical ProjectThe lectures are held in the first quarter after which a written exam (on the theory treated in the lectures) is taken. Parallel to the theory part,a practical project is done. The project is carried out in groups of (about) 4 students and the result is a verified model of an embedded system together with a comprehensive report on the steps towards to the model.","Literature and Study Materials":"J.F.

For both the written examination and the practical project a minimum of 5.0 is required in order to pass the course.","Enrolment / Application":"Blackboard","id":35644}
