{"courseName":"Neural Networks","ects":"6","Responsible Instructor":"Dr.J.A.Redi    ,J.A.Redi@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/2/2Pract.","Education Period":"3,4","Start Education":"3","Exam Period":"4,5","Course Language":"English","Expected prior knowledge":"A basic knowledge of pattern recogntion and AI techniques is useful but not required. Basic programming skills are also useful.","Study Goals":"Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:[LO1].Describe the different bio-inspired techniques reviewed in the course, such as Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, or Learning classifiers.[LO2].Research literature concerning one of the above techniques, summarize it and report it to their peers (e.g., by means of a power-point presentation or a demonstration)[LO3].Debate upon positive and negative aspects of the techniques mentioned above[LO4].Implement one or more of the above mentioned techniques in a computer language (e.g. Java, C, C++, Html, Matlab scripts�)[LO5].Determine which technique(s) is most appropriate for being used in a certain problem domain, for example learning algorithms for robot navigation in unknown environments[LO6].Apply the appropriate technique to a (simple) problem domain (e.g., simulation of robot navigation in a simple maze)","Education Method":"Seminar (including some lectures) and lab work.","Literature and Study Materials":"Research papers that will be available through Blackboard.","Assessment":"1. Presentation: during the lectures everyone presents one of the topics in the course.2. Group assignment: you experiment with one or more of the discussed techniques in a (simulated) robotics platform and write a research report on you findings.","id":36704}
