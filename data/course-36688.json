Probability Theory- Conditional) probabilities, the law of total probability, and Bayes� rule.- Solve probability problems that require the use of axioms of probability.2. Definition and Description of Random Variables and ProcessesPDF, PMF, CDF, Covariance, Correlation- Determine if a given PDF, PMF, CDF, variance, (auto/cross-)correlation(-function), (auto/cross-)covariance(-function), power spectral density complies with (theoretical and analytical) requirements. - Convert the description of a probabilistic problem into a probabilistic model using PDF, PMF, or CDF.3. PDF/PMF and Expected ValueCalculate the various forms of expected value of (combinations of) random variables and random processes- For a given (amplitude continuous/discrete and time continuous/discrete) probability model calculate the following probabilistic (marginal, joint and conditional) characterizations: PDF, PMF, CDF, probability of an event, expected value, variance, covariance, correlation, correlation coefficient, auto/crosscorrelation function, auto/crosscovariance function, (cross) power spectral density.- Calculate the PDF, PMF, expected value and variance of a derived random variable.4. Properties of Random Processes- Independence, orthogonality, uncorrelated, whiteness, IID- Determine if random variables/processes have the following properties: independent, orthogonal, uncorrelated, white, Poisson, Gaussian, Bernoulli, Markov, IID, stationary, WSS, ergodic.- Calculate the expected value, variance, auto/crosscorrelation(function), auto/crosscovariance(function), power spectral density of a linear combination of random variables and of a linearly filtered (WSS, amplitude discrete/continuous, time discrete/continuous) random process.5. Large NumbersCentral limit theorem, law of large numbers- Solve problems that require the use of the central limit theorem in an engineering context- Explain the law of the large numbers in an engineering context.6. Statistical Estimators- Estimated mean, variance, and correlation function- Given a set of outcomes, sample functions or realizations, calculate estimators for expected value, variance, and (auto-)correlation function.7. Application to Engineering Problems and Simulations- Select and translate a simple electrical engineering or computer science problem into mathematical probability model. The emphasis is on problems in signal and image processing, telecommunication, and media and knowledge technology. The class of probability models encompasses the following random variables/processes: Bernoulli, exponential, binomial, Poisson, Gaussian, uniform.- Justify and reflect on the approach taken in calculating or simulating (MatLab) the following probabilistic properties: PDF, PMF, expected value, variance, autocorrelation function, autocovariance function.8. Signals and Systems- Signal representation, linear time invariant (LTI) systems, impulse response, convolution, causality, difference equations, recursive and non-recursive systems, stability.9. Z-transform- Properties of Z-transform, region of convergence, rational transfer functions, inverse Z-transform, system analysis in the Z-domain, poles, zeros, stability.10. Fourier Transforms- Fourier series, continuous-time Fourier transform, discrete-time Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform, Fast Fourier transform (FFT), properties of Fourier transforms, frequency-domain characterization of LTI sytems.11. Sampling and Reconstruction of Signals- sampling theorem, sampling frequency, aliasing, folding, interpolation, D/A and A/D conversion.","Education Method":"Lectures, working groups (problem solving), laboratory work (Matlab exercises)","Literature and Study Materials":"J.G.

Before students can take part in the exam for part I, the students have to hand in pass the final laboratory exercise.","id":36688}
