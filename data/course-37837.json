Probability Theory- Conditional) probabilities, the law of total probability, and Bayes� rule.- Solve probability problems that require the use of axioms of probability.2. Definition and Description of Random Variables and ProcessesPDF, PMF, CDF, Covariance, Correlation- Determine if a given PDF, PMF, CDF, variance, (auto/cross-)correlation(-function), (auto/cross-)covariance(-function), power spectral density complies with (theoretical and analytical) requirements. - Convert the description of a probabilistic problem into a probabilistic model using PDF, PMF, or CDF.3. PDF/PMF and Expected ValueCalculate the various forms of expected value of (combinations of) random variables and random processes- For a given (amplitude continuous/discrete and time continuous/discrete) probability model calculate the following probabilistic (marginal, joint and conditional) characterizations: PDF, PMF, CDF, probability of an event, expected value, variance, covariance, correlation, correlation coefficient, auto/crosscorrelation function, auto/crosscovariance function, (cross) power spectral density.- Calculate the PDF, PMF, expected value and variance of a derived random variable.4. Properties of Random Processes- Independence, orthogonality, uncorrelated, whiteness, IID- Determine if random variables/processes have the following properties: independent, orthogonal, uncorrelated, white, Poisson, Gaussian, Bernoulli, Markov, IID, stationary, WSS, ergodic.- Calculate the expected value, variance, auto/crosscorrelation(function), auto/crosscovariance(function), power spectral density of a linear combination of random variables and of a linearly filtered (WSS, amplitude discrete/continuous, time discrete/continuous) random process.5. Large NumbersCentral limit theorem, law of large numbers- Solve problems that require the use of the central limit theorem in an engineering context- Explain the law of the large numbers in an engineering context.6. Statistical Estimators- Estimated mean, variance, and correlation function- Given a set of outcomes, sample functions or realizations, calculate estimators for expected value, variance, and (auto-)correlation function.12. Application to Engineering Problems and Simulations- Select and translate a simple electrical engineering or computer science problem into mathematical probability model. The emphasis is on problems in signal and image processing, telecommunication, and media and knowledge technology. The class of probability models encompasses the following random variables/processes: Bernoulli, exponential, binomial, Poisson, Gaussian, uniform.- Justify and reflect on the approach taken in calculating or simulating (MatLab) the following probabilistic properties: PDF, PMF, expected value, variance, autocorrelation function, autocovariance function.PART II:After finishing this course, the student is acquainted with several statistical techniques to analyse a multivariate dataset by means of a linear model. The student is capable of applying these techniques to a multivariate dataset by means of a statistical software package and is capable of interpreting the output drawing conclusions from it. The student is acquainted with the statistical notions and concepts that underly the statistical technique.","Education Method":"PART I:Lectures, working groups (problem solving), laboratory work (Matlab exercises)PART II:Classes, exercises and weekly mandatory computer assignments, that are graded.","Books":"PART I:R.D.
