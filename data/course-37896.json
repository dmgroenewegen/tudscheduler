Acquire in-depth knowledge about the physics and image reconstruction underlying X-ray, CT, acoustical and magnetic resonance imaging;2. Being able to solve elementary problems related to the theory mentioned in 1;3. Being able to solve more advanced problems addressing the theory mentioned in 1 by combining mathematical skills and physical insight;4. Able to acquire new knowledge about clinical applications of medical imaging.","Education Method":"Lectures, homework and assignments.","Literature and Study Materials":"Book: �Medical Imaging Signals & Systems�, Jerry L. Prince, Jonathan Links. Upper Saddle River NJ: Prentice Hall, 2005, 496 pp. ISBN: 0-13-065353-5Additional handouts wherever necessary.","Assessment":"The course on Medical Imaging comes with homework on (1) MR, (2) X-ray/CT and (3) Ultrasound imaging. By making the homework you can earn bonuspoints: 0.5 points for each of the topics, thus maximally 1.5 points(A).In addition, there will be an assignment for which you will need to hand in a paper and make a presentation. This can provide you with maximally 1 bonuspoint (B).Finally, there will be an exam graded from 0-10 (C).The final grade is calculated by: A + B + (10-A-B)*C/10.","Permitted Materials during Tests":"","id":37896}
