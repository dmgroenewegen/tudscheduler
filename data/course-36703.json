{"courseName":"Intelligent User Experience Engineering","ects":"6","Responsible Instructor":"Prof.dr.M.A.Neerincx    ,M.A.Neerincx@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/2/2","Education Period":"3,4","Start Education":"3","Exam Period":"none","Course Language":"English","Study Goals":"The main aim is to achieve an understanding and practical experience of key principles, methods and theories in the area of intelligent user experience engineering. The module provides opportunities for students to develop and demonstrate knowledge and understanding, qualities, skills and other attributes in the following areas:1. Knowledge of a basic, coherent approach for developing software technology in such a way that the users can accomplish their goals effectively and efficiently, and with a high level of satisfaction.2. Knowledge of recent theories and methods for improving human-technology collaboration with intelligent adaptive agents (ePartners), and of research approaches to enhance the theoretical and empirical foundation of such collaboration.3. Acquaintance with a situated cognitive engineering methodology for developing mutual human-automation empowerment in specific domains (e.g., for chronically ill or first responders). 4. Practical experience in an iterative human-centred development process, i.e. the application of theories and methods for the generation and testing of intelligent user interfaces. This process comprises the generation of a design with its rationale, and user experience testing with complementary data-analyses. The application domain is personalized music for improving the social, cognitive and affective conditions of older adults with dementia.","Education Method":"In the lectures, theories, models and methods are being presented and discussed from scientific literature. During a part of these lectures, student groups have to prepare presentations and discussions, addressing science and engineering issues. In the project, these groups will get practical experience in applying user-interface design and testing methods. They have to plan, execute, present and report a complete cognitive engineering process for a specific design question (i.e., a music application for older adults with dementia). The students will use the situated Cognitive Engineering Tool (sCET) to specify the design (incl. the trade-offs and choices).","Literature and Study Materials":"Papers from scientific journals on Blackboard.Lecture notes on Blackboard.","Assessment":"The module is assessed by coursework and an exam as follows:1. Exam of the theory (oral examination on topics presented in the reading material and discussed in the lectures; 50%)2. Project (the presentations and final report; 50%)PROJECTThe project will be in the area of socio-cognitive support forpersons who have to cope withcritical, demanding situations. The current topic is the development of a music application for persons with dementia, their caregivers, friends and family. Students work in small groups to (re)design and evaluate such support. They will apply the cognitive theories in a scenario-based development process by claim analyses. Interim results will be regularly presented during the lecture (in total 5 presentations will be given in so-called �milestones�). At the end, each team will present and discuss the evaluation results.","Exam Hours":"Individual oral exam.","Enrolment / Application":"Blackboard","id":36703}
