{"courseName":"Computer Vision","ects":"5","Responsible Instructor":"H.Dibeklioglu    ,H.Dibeklioglu@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/0/2 en 4 uur werkcollege in 4e Q","Education Period":"4","Start Education":"4","Exam Period":"4,5","Course Language":"English","Expected prior knowledge":"You are expected to have a working understanding of linear algebra, and of probability and statistics. Knowledge about pattern recognition and/or machine learning is preferred.","Study Goals":"After successfully completing this course:- You are able to explain and implement various techniques for feature point detection, and can explain the type of feature points these detectors identify.- You are able to explain and implement techniques for feature point description and feature point matching. You are able to use these techniques in applications such as object detection and image stitching.- You are able to explain and implement techniques for image stitching. The student understands the key problems in developing image-stitching algorithms (such as alignment and parallax removal).- You are able to explain and implement techniques for shape analysis.- You are able to explain and implement techniques for face detection and face recognition. - You are able to explain and implement techniques for object recognition and scene understanding.- You are able to explain and implement basic techniques for feature tracking, in particular, Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracking and particle filter tracking. - You are able to explain Markov Random Field models, and is able to use such models in problems such as image denoising and inpainting.- You are able to develop and explain computer vision systems for real-world applications. In particular, you are able to select computer vision techniques that are to solve a specific image analysis or image understanding problem, to motivate this selection, and to combine the selected techniques into a working computer vision system.","Education Method":"- Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10.5, and 14; Appendix B of �Computer Vision, Algorithms and Applications�, R.

If you have take comparable courses at other universities, this is also fine. Please contact the instructor when in doubt!Prerequisite courses (preferred): Pattern recognition (IN4085).","Assessment":"The assessment for this course consist of two main parts:1) You will develop a computer vision system for an application of your choice, and will write a small report with a description of your system. Your grade for the project forms 50% of the final grade for the course.2) A written final exam will determine the remaining 50% of your final grade. The final exam covers: (1) all content covered in the lectures and (2) all material listed under �Course material�. The final exam is an open-book exam: all slides and course material can be used during the exam.","id":36699}
