The lectures will be given in a block of 2-3 weeks at Delft University of Technology. After that, several interactive sessions (including student presentations and code reviews) with the USA (Silicon Valley) will be held over skype. Due to the 9 hour time difference, these sessions will take place in the (early) evening.The exact timing of the blocks in Delft differs per year, and will be announced on blackboard.","Books":"Programming in HaskellGraham Hutton, University of NottinghamCambridge University Press, 2007Paperback: �23.99 / $45.00 (ISBN-13: 9780521692694 | ISBN-10: 0521692695)eBook: $36.00 (ISBN-13: 9780511292187 | ISBN-10: 051129218X) Kindle: $36.00 (ASIN: B001FSKE6Q)","Assessment":"The grade for this course will be based on (1) group participation; (2) lab work; (3) a paper describing the lab work or explaining advanced functional programming concepts to practitioners; (4) final presentation of paper and lab work.","id":36676}
