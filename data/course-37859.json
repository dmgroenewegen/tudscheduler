{"courseName":"Electronics for Quantum Computation","ects":"5","Responsible Instructor":"K.L.M.Bertels    ,K.L.M.Bertels@tudelft.nl , Prof.dr.E.Charbon    ,E.Charbon@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/0/4","Education Period":"4","Start Education":"4","Exam Period":"4,5","Course Language":"English","Study Goals":"The course will be an introduction to quantum computing, covering error quantum correction, fault tolerance, and surface codes. Labs will focus on the simulation, detection, and correction of errors using field- programmable-gate-arrays (FPGAs). Students will get familiar with the concepts of quantum computing while practicing to interface to a quantum computer in real life.","Education Method":"The course will focus on electronics for quantum computing, both ASICs and reconfigurable architectures.There will be weekly lectures & labs: 2-hour lecture on first day, 1-hour lecture + 1-hour exercises/lab or a 2-hour lab on second day. The lab will be available to students for completing assignments.","Assessment":"There will be a final exam and a project at the end of the quarter. 6 labs will receive a pass/no pass assessment.","id":37859}
