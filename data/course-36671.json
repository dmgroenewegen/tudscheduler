{"courseName":"Mining Software Repositories","ects":"5","Responsible Instructor":"A.Bacchelli    ,A.Bacchelli@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/5/0/0","Education Period":"2","Start Education":"2","Exam Period":"2,3","Course Language":"English","Study Goals":"This course explores techniques and leading research in mining Software Engineering data, discusses challenges associated with mining SE data, highlights SE data mining success stories, and outlines future research directions. Students will acquire the knowledge needed to perform research or conduct practice in the field. Once completed, students should be able to do data science on software repositories in their own research or practice.","Education Method":"Frontal lectures with hands-on tutorials. Students will learn techniques of data mining and see how these were practically applied in software engineering context.","Assessment":"One original project done alone or in a group of 2 or 3 students. The project will explore one or more of the themes covered in the course from a novel perspective (e.g., on new data). The project will be graded according to originality and interestingness, depth of the work, correctness of the analysis, and the presentation quality of the written (6-page IEEE format) report and accompanying source code.","id":36671}
