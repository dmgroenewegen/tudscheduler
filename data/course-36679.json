{"courseName":"Complex Networks from Nature to Man-made Networks","ects":"4","Responsible Instructor":"H.Wang    ,H.Wang@tudelft.nl","Contact Hours / Week  x/x/x/x":"0/0/2/0","Education Period":"3","Start Education":"3","Exam Period":"none","Course Language":"English","Study Goals":"EE variant:After this course, students could represent/abstract a complex system such as a brain or a communication system as a complex network, understand the basic methods to analyze properties of networks and dynamic processes on the networks, design robust networks against e.g. failures and epidemics and be able to apply them to real-world complex systems. CS variant: After this course, students could construct the network based on the dataset, characterize and model the network, model the data via e.g. dynamic processes (e.g. viral information spreading) on networks, in order to possibly predicate the future e.g. the popularity of a product, news, or a social network and the prevalence of a disease/computer virus.Both variants: Students could obtain an overview of the Msc/Phd projects on the frontiers of complex networks and networked data analysis.","Education Method":"In total, there will be 7 lectures where one lecture is given by a guest lecturer on the applications in one specific domain e.g. economy, social networks and the brain.","Assessment":"Assessment is based on both homework assignments and the exam (or project).The homework requires basic programming (in e.g matlab or C)","id":36679}
